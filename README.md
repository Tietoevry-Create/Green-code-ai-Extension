## Usage

2. If it is your first time using the extension, a registration window will prompt you for your OpenAI API key and other relevant details. You can choose between using an Azure OpenAI resource or an OpenAI account. In both cases, you will need an API key to utilize the tool.

3. if you have already registered your information and have set a password for your account, you might be asked for your password at startup.

   - If, during registration, you chose to set the frequency of the password prompt to "Every time", then you will consistenly be asked for your password at startup.
   - If the frequency was set to "Every 7 days", you will be asked for your password at the first startup that occurs 7 days after the last time the password was entered.

4. After entering your information and saving or submitting it, you can begin by highlighting a section of your code that you would like to receive feedback on. Then, press "Get Feedback" to receive detailed tips on how to make your code greener.

5. Post-registration/login, you can modify or remove your information at any time by opening the settings menu, represented by a gear icon located at the bottom right-hand corner of the extension's text area.
