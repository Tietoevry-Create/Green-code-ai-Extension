# Green Code AI Extension

The Green Code AI extension enhances your Visual Studio Code experience by integrating with Green Code AI services, providing advanced code analysis capabilities.

## Features

The Green Code AI extension provides the following features:

- **Code Analysis**: Leverage the power of Green Code AI to analyze your code for best practices, potential issues, and improvements.
- **Secure Configuration**: Safely store and manage your OpenAI API key and other sensitive information using VS Code's secure storage.

## Installation

Download the Green Code AI extension from VS Code Marketplace.

## Usage

1. Open Green Code AI from VS Code's primary sidebar (usually located to the left of the editor window).

2. If it is your first time using the extension, a registration window will prompt you for your OpenAI API key and other relevant details. You can choose between using an Azure OpenAI resource or an OpenAI account. In both cases, you will need an API key to utilize the tool.

3. if you have already registered your information and have set a password for your account, you might be asked for your password at startup.

   - If, during registration, you chose to set the frequency of the password prompt to "Every time", then you will consistenly be asked for your password at startup.
   - If the frequency was set to "Every 7 days", you will be asked for your password at the first startup that occurs 7 days after the last time the password was entered.

4. After entering your information and saving or submitting it, you can begin by highlighting a section of your code that you would like to receive feedback on. Then, press "Get Feedback" to receive detailed tips on how to make your code greener.

5. Post-registration/login, you can modify or remove your information at any time by opening the settings menu, represented by a gear icon located at the bottom right-hand corner of the extension's text area.
