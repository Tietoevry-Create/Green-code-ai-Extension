    * Analyze database queries for inefficiencies and optimize them.
    * Use indexing and caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database and improve query performance.
* **Ensure efficiency of concurrent code**:
    * Implement proper synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores to avoid race conditions and improve concurrency control.
    * Profile and tune concurrent code to minimize contention and maximize resource utilization.
* **Use server virtualization and application containerization when possible**:
    * Use virtualization technologies such as VMs or containerization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes to improve resource utlization and scalability.
    * Containerize applications to ensure consistent and efficient deployment across environments.
* **Practice regular and concise code documentation**:
    * Encourage clear and consise code documentation to aid in understanding and maintenance of the code.
    * Use tools for generating documentation automatically from code comments.
* **Implement Test Driven Development (TDD)**
    * Adopt TDD practices in order to aim for correctness and efficiency from the start.
    * Write tests that cover performance and resource usage aspects to catch regressions.
* **Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, deployment and scaling for efficient code delivery**:
    * Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate code testing and deployment.
